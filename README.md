# simple-weather-util

Simple Weather Util is a project used to visualize the present weather data for a given location. The application was developed entirely using the JavaScript language and its development is the result of following the lectures of a Udemy course for Node (Server-side JavaScript). The data used in the application is queried from Dark Sky's weather data API which returns the requested data in a JSON format. 



### Important Notes
This project is no longer under active development since it was a tutorial based project that helped me learn some of the ins and outs of the JavaScript programming language. Additionally, Dark Sky has provided notice to its users that support for the weather data API will be terminated at the end of the year 2022
